          I had assumed I did not have the right skills to be a developer - but
          when a colleague suggested it might suit me, I got curious, and it's
          since become something I love! I'm learning to code with
          <a href="https://www.shecodes.io/" title="Link to ShedCodes website"
            >SheCodes</a

          and host SEO-friendly sites on Netlify. I have built applications
          using JavaScript, Python, APIs, and AI tools. My

          I've worked in research ops since 2009, developing processes from the
          ground up through to implementation. I use SPSS and R to handle data,
          and I am hoping to apply Python soon as well. I have a certification
          in Data Analysis from

          I currently live in Bristol in the southwest of England. In 2023, I
          was diagnosed with ADHD, which has shaped how I work and learn. When I
          am not coding, I enjoy hanging out with my cats and husband and
          bingeing TV.
